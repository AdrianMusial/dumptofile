dumptofile
==========

A [Terminator] (https://launchpad.net/terminator) plugin for 1-click dumping of the console contents to a text file (~/.terminator/$datetime.log)

One needs to copy the plugin to /usr/share/terminator/terminatorlib/plugins/ and enable it under preferences to make the context-menu (named "DumpToFile") appear. Dump files are stored under ~/.terminator
